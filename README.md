This repository contains my SMAPI mods for Stardew Valley. See the individual mods for
documentation and release notes.

## Mods
* **BusSprite mod** <small>([Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/11809))</small>  
  _Part of a mostly visual mod "Ribeena's vehicles", this makes the bus
  a bit more responsive and moves the bus door._

## Translating the mods

The mods can be translated into any language supported by the game, and SMAPI will automatically
use the right translations.

Contributions are welcome! See [Modding:Translations](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Translations)
on the wiki for help contributing translations.
